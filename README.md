CodingIsCool is a coding platform I made! This was made mainly for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but you can also create other files such as Python, Java, C, C++, JSON, SVG, CSV, and even plain text. It allows you to run Python code!

## Features
- Save your changes
- Store your files
- Share your files
- Different themes
- Autocompletion
- Run Python code!

For HTML files, you can view it in a new tab, and you will see the page that you have made. You can share the link with other people as well! For CSS and JavaScript files, view it in a new tab, copy the link, and you can link those files to your HTML file.

You can see a guide on how to use this in the `guide.md` file, or go to https://codingiscool.ruiwenge2.repl.co/help. Start by [signing up](https://codingiscool.ruiwenge2.repl.co/signup)!
